### Research Experience

Research Assistant | Work-Study | Rotjan Marine Ecology Lab | Boston University                          09 2018 â€“ Present
http://sites.bu.edu/rotjanlab/members/ 
20+ hours a week
  -Examine deep sea, open ocean, and coral reef fish larvae in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area as part of a 10-year project determining how community assemblages shift with ENSO cycles (~45 fish taxa and 28 invertebrate taxa)
  -Maintain temperate and tropical aquarium systems. Including husbandry of corals, anemones, and mantis shrimp, water quality testing/monitoring, feeding, and cleaning
  -Mentor fellow undergraduates in husbandry and lab protocols as they began doing research, and how use the microscopes, sort zooplankton, and identify larval fish 
  -Present my work at Rotjan Lab meetings, help to edit and write manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals
