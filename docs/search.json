My name is Allie Cole (she/her) and I am a marine scientist who loves to dive and explore the oceans. I graduated from Boston University in 2021 with a bachelor’s degree in Marine Science. At BU, my research was exploring how larval fish distributions are changing with climate patterns. I taught a team of eight students how to identify larval fish and plankton, and worked with multiple international collaborators. I was the recipient of the Lara Vincent Undergraduate Research Award for this research. You can see a summary video of the data collection here Analysis of this data led me to UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Sciences and Management, where I am currently working towards a Masters in Environmental Data Science. Turning my raw data into understandable results was an incredibly interesting process and one I want to become very comfortable in. I am interested in bridging the gap between research and data analysis, making data more open and accessible. Eventually I would like to be asking questions within marine ecology and using the knowledge gained in my masters program to share the answers I find.\n            \n            \n              Hello!
