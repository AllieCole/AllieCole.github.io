Hello! My name is Allie Cole (she/her) and I am a marine scientist who loves to dive and explore the oceans. I graduated from Boston University in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in Marine Science. My previous research is in larval fish identification from the Central Pacific, exploring how their distributions are changing with climate patterns. I was the recipient of the Lara Vincent Undergraduate Research Award for this work. You can see a summary video of the data collection here. Analysis of this data led me to the Bren school where I am currently working towards a Masters in Environmental Data Science. I am interested in bridging the gap between research and data analysis, making data more open and accessible. Eventually I would like to be asking questions within marine ecology and using the knowledge gained in my masters program to share the answers I find.
